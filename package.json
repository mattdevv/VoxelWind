  "description": "The Voxel-Based Wind Simulation System is an advanced computational model designed to simulate and visualize the complex behaviors of wind currents within a three-dimensional space. Utilizing a grid of voxels, this system meticulously calculates the movement of air through various environments, accounting for factors such as direction, speed, and interactions with obstacles and local wind zones.",
